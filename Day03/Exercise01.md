###  Employee Management System Using Hibernate

#### Objective
Develop an employee management system leveraging Hibernate for ORM. This system will manage departments, employees, and projects, highlighting the use of bidirectional relationships to efficiently navigate and manage related entities.

#### Detailed Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Install Java JDK, set up an IDE, and initialize a Maven project.
   - Add Hibernate and database dependencies in `pom.xml`.
   - Configure Hibernate using `hibernate.cfg.xml`.

2. **Entity Relationships and Annotations**
   - **Department Entity**:
     - Fields for `id` and `name`.
     - Bidirectional one-to-many relationship with `Employee`, utilizing `@OneToMany` and `mappedBy`.
   - **Employee Entity**:
     - Fields for `id`, `name`, and `position`.
     - Many-to-one relationship with `Department` using `@ManyToOne`.
     - Many-to-many relationship with `Project`, ensuring it's bidirectional with `@ManyToMany` and `mappedBy`.
   - **Project Entity**:
     - Fields for `id` and `title`.
     - Bidirectional many-to-many relationship with `Employee` using `@ManyToMany` and a join table.

3. **DAO Layer**
   - Implement DAOs for each entity, focusing on CRUD operations.
   - Include methods for associating employees with departments and projects.

4. **Operations and Data Management**
   - Demonstrate creating departments, employees, projects, and managing their associations.
   - Show how to navigate relationships, like retrieving all employees of a department or all projects an employee is working on.

5. **Testing and Validation**
   - Use a `Main` class to demonstrate the system's capabilities, including CRUD operations and relationship management.

#### Advanced Features (Optional)
- Implement lazy loading to optimize data retrieval.
- Add transaction management to ensure data integrity.

#### Deliverables
- Source code for entities with bidirectional relationships.
- DAO implementations for CRUD operations and relationship management.
- A `Main` class showcasing system functionality.

#### Evaluation Criteria
- Correct implementation of bidirectional relationships.
- Effective use of Hibernate for CRUD operations and relationship management.
- Code clarity and adherence to best practices.

This approach, focusing on bidirectional relationships, offers a comprehensive understanding of managing complex relationships in Hibernate, preparing you for more advanced data modeling and manipulation tasks in real-world applications.
