### Task 1: Integrating `EntityManager` with Hibernate

#### Objective
Refactor your application to use JPA's `EntityManager` for basic CRUD operations on the `Employee` entity.

#### Steps
1. **Setup JPA Configuration**: Ensure your `persistence.xml` is correctly configured in the `META-INF` directory of your project's resources. Define the persistence unit with appropriate properties.
   
2. **Refactor `EmployeeDAO` to Use `EntityManager`**:
   - Modify the constructor to initialize `EntityManagerFactory` using `Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("yourPersistenceUnitName")`.
   - Implement the `createEmployee`, `getEmployeeById`, `updateEmployee`, and `deleteEmployee` methods using `EntityManager` to perform transactions.
   
3. **Test CRUD Operations**: Write unit tests or a simple main method to test the CRUD operations for the `Employee` entity to ensure everything is working as expected with the new setup.

### Task 2: Query Employees by Department Using HQL

#### Objective
Write a method in `EmployeeDAO` that returns a list of all employees belonging to a specific department using HQL.

#### Method Signature
```java
public List<Employee> findEmployeesByDepartment(String departmentName);
```

#### Implementation Steps
1. Use `EntityManager` to create an HQL query: `"FROM Employee E WHERE E.department.name = :departmentName"`.
2. Set the `departmentName` parameter on the query.
3. Execute the query and return the result list.

### Task 3: Calculate Average Salary Within Each Department Using HQL

#### Objective
Implement a method to calculate and return the average salary within each department.

#### Method Signature
```java
public List<Object[]> calculateAverageSalaryByDepartment();
```

#### Implementation Steps
1. Write an HQL query to group employees by department and calculate the average salary: `"SELECT E.department.name, AVG(E.salary) FROM Employee E GROUP BY E.department.name"`.
2. Execute the query and return the results.

### Task 4: Update Employee Positions in Bulk by Department Using HQL

#### Objective
Bulk update the positions of all employees in a given department to a new position using HQL.

#### Method Signature
```java
public void updateEmployeePositions(String departmentName, String newPosition);
```

#### Implementation Steps
1. Begin a transaction using `EntityManager`.
2. Create and execute an HQL query: `"UPDATE Employee E SET E.position = :newPosition WHERE E.department.name = :departmentName"`.
3. Commit the transaction.

### Task 5: Retrieve All Employees With No Projects Assigned Using HQL

#### Objective
Find all employees who are not assigned to any projects.

#### Method Signature
```java
public List<Employee> findEmployeesWithoutProjects();
```

#### Implementation Steps
1. Use HQL to select employees without projects: `"FROM Employee E WHERE E.projects IS EMPTY"`.
2. Execute the query and return the list of employees.
