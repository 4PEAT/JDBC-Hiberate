### Task: Employee Management System with Hibernate

#### Objectives:
- Implement a simple employee management system.
- Use Hibernate to manage the persistence layer.
- Understand and apply unidirectional and bidirectional relationships.
- Utilize join columns to connect entities.
- Perform CRUD operations.

#### Entities:
1. **Department**: Represents departments within the company.
2. **Employee**: Represents employees working in a department.
3. **Project**: Represents projects that employees can be assigned to.

#### Relationships:
1. **Department to Employee**: 
   - Unidirectional one-to-many relationship (a department has many employees, but employees don't need to know their department).
2. **Employee to Project**: 
   - Bidirectional many-to-many relationship (employees can work on multiple projects, and projects can have multiple employees).

#### Tasks:

1. **Configure the Hibernate Environment**:
   - Set up the Hibernate configuration file (`hibernate.cfg.xml`) with the database details.
   - Use the H2 in-memory database for simplicity.

2. **Define the Entities with Annotations**:
   - Create `Department`, `Employee`, and `Project` entities with proper Hibernate annotations.
   - Use `@OneToMany` for the unidirectional relationship between `Department` and `Employee`.
   - Use `@ManyToMany` with `@JoinTable` for the bidirectional relationship between `Employee` and `Project`.

3. **Implement CRUD Operations**:
   - Write methods to perform the following operations:
     - **Create (C)**: Add new departments, employees, and projects.
     - **Read (R)**: Retrieve and display a list of all departments with their employees, and a list of all projects with their assigned employees.
     - **Update (U)**: Change an employee’s department, update project details, and manage employee-project assignments.
     - **Delete (D)**: Remove an employee, a department, or a project.

4. **Testing Your Setup**:
   - Create a main class or integration tests to demonstrate the CRUD operations.
   - Test the unidirectional relationship by adding employees to a department and then retrieving the department’s employees.
   - Test the bidirectional relationship by assigning employees to projects, and then retrieving both the employees for a project and the projects for an employee.

5. **Bonus Challenges**:
   - Implement lazy loading for the Department to Employee relationship and demonstrate how it works.
   - Add transaction management to handle operations that require multiple steps and may need to be rolled back.

#### Deliverables:
1. Source code for all entities with annotations.
2. Source code for the service layer containing the CRUD operations.
3. Main class or tests showcasing the operations and results.

### Improved Task Description

#### Task: Employee Management System with Hibernate

#### Objectives:
- Implement a simple employee management system.
- Utilize Hibernate for managing the persistence layer.
- Apply unidirectional and bidirectional relationships.
- Use join columns to connect entities.
- Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations effectively.

#### Entities:
1. **Department**:
   - Fields: `id` (Primary Key), `name` (String), `employees` (Set of Employee)
2. **Employee**:
   - Fields: `id` (Primary Key), `name` (String), `position` (String), `department` (Department), `projects` (Set of Project)
3. **Project**:
   - Fields: `id` (Primary Key), `title` (String), `employees` (Set of Employee)

#### Relationships:
1. **Department to Employee**:
   - Unidirectional One-to-Many (A department can have many employees)
2. **Employee to Project**:
   - Bidirectional Many-to-Many (Employees can work on multiple projects, and projects can have multiple employees)

#### Tasks:

1. **Configure the Hibernate Environment**:
   - Set up the Hibernate configuration file with the necessary database details.
   - Use the H2 in-memory database for simplicity in development and testing.

2. **Define the Entities with Annotations**:
   - Create entities `Department`, `Employee`, and `Project` with appropriate Hibernate annotations.
   - Use `@OneToMany` for the unidirectional relationship between `Department` and `Employee`.
   - Use `@ManyToMany` with `@JoinTable` for the bidirectional relationship between `Employee` and `Project`.

3. **Implement CRUD Operations**:
   - **Create (C)**: Add new departments, employees, and projects.
   - **Read (R)**: Retrieve and display departments with their employees, and projects with their assigned employees.
   - **Update (U)**: Change an employee’s department, update project details, and manage employee-project assignments.
   - **Delete (D)**: Remove an employee, a department, or a project.

4. **Testing Your Setup**:
   - Create a main class or integration tests to demonstrate CRUD operations.
   - Test the unidirectional relationship by adding employees to a department and retrieving the department’s employees.
   - Test the bidirectional relationship by assigning employees to projects and retrieving both the employees for a project and the projects for an employee.

5. **Bonus Challenges**:
   - Implement lazy loading for the Department to Employee relationship to optimize performance.
   - Add transaction management to handle complex operations that require multiple steps and may need to be rolled back.

#### Deliverables:
1. **Entities with Annotations**:
   - Source code for `Department`, `Employee`, and `Project` entities.
2. **Service Layer for CRUD Operations**:
   - Source code for DAO classes handling CRUD operations.
3. **Main Class or Tests**:
   - Main class or test cases demonstrating CRUD operations and relationship management.
